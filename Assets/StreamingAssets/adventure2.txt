The road leads to a workers’ town with a royal monument. A towering mercenary known as the Barbarian King supervises stone hauling, while an archer commander oversees range drills outside the walls. A temple scribe notices your curiosity and invites you inside.

At the canal crossing, a group of traveling performers prepares a river barge. Among them is a quiet scholar people call the Grand Warden, said to have studied temple astronomy, while a spear-bearing scout—known simply as the Royal Champion—keeps watch along the embankment.

Inside the scribal chamber, the priest studies your <color=#006400>Green Gem</color> and instructs you to place it into a carved basin. When sunlight strikes the gem, a narrow beam reflects onto a map etched into the wall, revealing a hidden desert route once used during the reign of Hatshepsut.

You reach a partially buried temple. A heavily armored traveler called P.E.K.K.A attempts to rotate the ancient celestial mechanism, but lacks the precise alignment. You notice that the etchings match with those inscribed on your <color=#006400>gemstone</color>.

The canal leads to a logistics station where scribes record grain shipments headed to Thebes. A cheerful rider nicknamed the Hog Rider by dockworkers arrives carrying tax reports from upriver. With no trace of the temple route here, your search reaches a dead end.

You awaken beside the Nile floodplain during Egypt’s New Kingdom. Barges drift along distant canals while merchants guide donkey caravans toward nearby settlements.

The road leads to a workers’ town with a royal monument. A towering mercenary known as the Barbarian King supervises stone hauling, while an archer commander oversees range drills outside the walls. A temple scribe notices your curiosity and invites you inside.

At the canal crossing, a group of traveling performers prepares a river barge. Among them is a quiet scholar people call the Grand Warden, said to have studied temple astronomy, while a spear-bearing scout—known simply as the Royal Champion—keeps watch along the embankment.

Inside the scribal chamber, the priest studies your <color=#006400>Green Gem</color> and instructs you to place it into a carved solar basin. When sunlight strikes the gem, a narrow beam reflects onto a map etched into the wall, revealing a hidden desert route once used by expeditions sent during the reign of Hatshepsut.

You reach a partially buried temple. A heavily armored traveler called P.E.K.K.A attempts to rotate an ancient celestial mechanism but lacks the precise alignment. Nearby, a wandering engineer known as the Mighty Miner studies underground passageways, hoping to chart them for future expeditions.

The canal leads to a royal logistics station where scribes record grain shipments headed to Thebes. A cheerful rider famous for leaping canal barriers—nicknamed the Hog Rider by dockworkers—arrives carrying tax reports from upriver. With no trace of the temple route here, your search reaches a dead end.

ITEM: The Sphinx’s Riddle

The aligned mechanism opens a concealed chamber containing an ancient <color=#DAA520>stone tablet</color>, once presented to initiates who proved their understanding of Ma’at—truth, balance, and order. Word spreads quickly among the scattered adventurers you encountered along the journey: the scholar Warden, the armored wanderer, the canal scout, and the monument builders all recognize that the discovery belongs not to conquerors, but to those who preserve knowledge.

You arrive at the ruins, but without activating the temple’s ancient mechanism the inner sanctuary remains sealed by shifting stone corridors.

You awaken inside a ring of floating lanterns. Nearby, a King, Queen, and Wizard discuss an old legend about three Pig Artisans, whose final creation remains a mystery. You see a curtain of light and hear the distant roar of rushing water.

[Enter the shimmering curtain -> 2]
[Follow the roar of water -> 3]

You step into a traveling carnival filled with ribbons, puppets, and laughing spectators. A Bandit flips coins while a Knight observes the crowd. The puppet show repeats a strange sequence: a piglet on four legs, a builder walking upright, and an elder pig leaning on a staff.

[Approach the puppet-master -> 4]
[Slip beyond the carnival tents -> 8]

The roaring sound leads to a towering waterfall crashing into a misty basin. Miners operate a creaking lift while a warm-sleeping Baby Dragon rests beside the machinery.

[Walk along the quiet misty ledge -> 6]
[Ride the lift into the cliffside hollow -> 8]

The puppet-master gestures toward your satchel. “You already carry what the gate requires.” You remove <color=#DAA520>The Sphinx’s Riddle</color>, its symbols glowing faintly. “The three pigs lived out the answer - four legs in youth, two in middle-age, three in old age. Remember that.”

[Study the glowing parchment -> 5]

A circular stair rises toward a silent stone gate marked with shifting footprints - hoofprints, then walking prints, then prints beside a cane.

[Return to the carnival grounds -> 2]
[Speak the life-steps aloud -> 7]

The ledge narrows into a peaceful overlook where drifting Healers glide above the mist. Nothing more calls you onward, and the journey slowly settles into stillness.

You declare: “Piglet on four, builder on two, elder on three.” The gate opens gently, revealing a glowing <color=#8B0000>red apple</color>, the reward left by the Three Pig Artisans.

You arrive before the silent stone gate, but it does not react without the riddle’s spoken answer.

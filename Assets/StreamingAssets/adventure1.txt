You wake up in a dimly lit forest clearing. The air smells of pine and damp earth. A narrow trail leads north, and you can hear running water to the east.

[Follow the trail north -> 2]
[Head toward the water -> 3]

=== PAGE 2 ===
The trail opens into a small village. A few wooden houses line a dirt road. An old woman sits on a porch, watching you. A signpost points west toward "The Ruins."

[Talk to the old woman -> 4]
[Head toward the ruins -> 8]

=== PAGE 3 ===
You push through the underbrush and find a gentle stream. A wooden bridge crosses it, and on the other side you see a cave entrance carved into a hillside.

[Cross the bridge and enter the cave -> 8]
[Follow the stream downstream -> 6]

The old woman smiles. "Traveler, the ruins hold what you seek — but beware the guardian. Take this." She hands you a rusty iron key.

[Thank her and head to the ruins -> 5]

=== PAGE 5 ===
Ancient stone walls rise around you, covered in moss. At the far end, a heavy door stands sealed with an iron lock. Strange symbols glow faintly on its surface.

[Use the iron key on the door -> 7]
[Turn back -> 2]

=== PAGE 6 ===
The stream leads to a peaceful lake. Dragonflies dance over the surface. There is nothing more to find here — only stillness. Your journey ends quietly by the water.

The key turns with a satisfying click. The door groans open, revealing a chamber filled with golden light. In the center, a single gemstone hovers in the air. You reach out and take it. Warmth floods through you. The adventure is over — you have found what you were looking for.
